# Checklist dApp â€” Algorand (Simple Stateful Contract)

**One-line:** A minimal Algorand stateful smart contract that maintains a global `task` status and exposes `markDone` and `reset` methods.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a **beginner-friendly stateful Algorand smart contract** (written using the `@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript` style) that provides two simple task-tracking operations:

* **markDone**: Sets the status of a global task to "done".
* **reset**: Resets the task status back to "pending".

Itâ€™s intentionally minimal, to help you understand how to:

* Define and update global state with string values.
* Write simple contract methods to change that state.
* Interact with a contract from a script or frontend.

---

## What it does

* Exposes two methods:
  * `markDone()` â†’ Sets the global `task` state to `"done"`.
  * `reset()` â†’ Sets the global `task` state back to `"pending"`.
* Global state stores a single string key: `task`.
* Returns the updated task status after each operation.

**Typical workflow:**

1. The contract starts with the `task` state as "pending".
2. A user calls `markDone()` â†’ the `task` state changes to "done".
3. A user calls `reset()` â†’ the `task` state changes back to "pending".
4. The global state `task` can be queried by any client to see the current status.

---

## Features

* Minimal, easy-to-follow stateful Algorand smart contract.
* Implements simple state-change logic (`pending` â†” `done`).
* Global state tracks a single `task` status string.
* Beginner-friendly structure for extending into larger to-do list or workflow dApps.

## Contract interface & quick explanation

Hereâ€™s the Checklist contract code:

```ts
import { Contract, GlobalState } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class Checklist extends Contract {
  task = GlobalState<string>({ key: "task", initialValue: "pending" })

  markDone(): string {
    this.task.value = "done"
    return this.task.value
  }

  reset(): string {
    this.task.value = "pending"
    return this.task.value
  }
}
````

## How to call the contract (example)

You can call the contract's methods using various tools like the AlgoKit CLI, Goal, or any Algorand SDK.

**Using AlgoKit CLI:**

```bash
# Mark the task as done
algokit call testnet-app-745629445 markDone

# Reset the task to pending
algokit call testnet-app-745629445 reset
```

-----

## Limitations & suggested improvements

This is a very basic example with some clear limitations:

  * **Single Global Task:** It only tracks one task for everyone.
  * **No Customization:** The task itself isn't defined, only its state.

**Suggested Improvements:**

  * **User-Specific Tasks:** Use Local State (`LocalState<string>`) to allow each user account to have their own task status.
  * **Multiple Tasks:** Expand the contract to manage a list of tasks, perhaps by serializing an array into a global state value or using multiple state keys.
  * **Custom Task Names:** Add a method that allows a user to set the text of the task, e.g., `createTask(name: string)`.

## Development / Local testing (quick start)

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Run tests:** `npm test`
4.  **Deploy (using AlgoKit):** `algokit deploy`
